# RAC Best Practices
Bryan Vongrave

## Preventing Known Issues

**ORACHK**
- proactive, run before issue happens
- self service
- get latest release from MOS: 126827.1
- create user defined checks
- upgrade validation (11.2.0.3+)

**Orachk Collection Manager**
- Companion APEX
- UI for authoring user defined checks
- Can create/edit user defined check using XML.

## Reactive

### TFA
- Simplify diagnostic data collection
- single command, clusterwide collection for **all** components
- files trimmed around the incident time and consolidated on one node
- MOS: 1513912.2

### Support Tools Bundle
- Version downloaded from MOS includes orachk, oswatcher, etc.
- can run all tools using TFA shell ```tfactl diagcollect```

### OSWatcher
- runs every 30 seconds
- output required for node reboot and performance issues

### Cluster Health Monitor (CHM)
- will eventually replace OSWatcher.  They compliment each other right now.
- May want to increase data retention period (default is 1 day).

### Procwatcher
- queries V$ wait chains
- include with SR to reduce resolution time

### All RAC scenarios

```
#Collect data 12 hrs before and 12 hrs after given time
tfactl diagcollect -for <time>
```

You can enable real time diag collection...


# OEM Security
CON 9719

TLS enabled out of box for EM 13c
*see slides for ports to open on firewall*

EM Repository - Backup and secure encryption key

13c Disable sysman from logging into OEM (*slides*)

13c Fined Grained Authorization Privileges
- out of box privs for DBA, developers, etc...
- Best practice - create group and assign privs to group (use propogate privilege)
- share restricted named credentials with private role

Password Management
- monitor user expiry (dbsnmp pswd)
- get_db_account ass in ```-expire_in_hours```

```
emcli update_host_password
emcli update_db_password
emcli update_named_password
```

# DB Security Customer Panel

Oracle 12c security ebook?

Everyone uses Advanced Security feature.

OEM lifecycle management pack - compliance templates
DB Vault - least privilege

> Compliance is not a checklist, it's a mindset

Limit DBA access to sensitive data (keys to the kingdom).  See DB Vault whitepapers.

Authorization
- limit shared accounts
- OS User in audit log (audit vault?)
- DBA account should be in oracle user group and avoid sudo to oracle user.  But don't bounce the DB!  It will come back up owned by DBA user.  

### TDE
Encrypt **ALL** tablespaces except sys, sysaux, undo, system (others?).  Include any tablespace users have privileges to create objects.


# Load Balancing in Platform as a Service
CON 8649

## Traffic Directory 12c
- equivalent to ELB?

Lifecycle Management
- within domain
- monitors for new servers
- automagically adds new servers to traffic director

Oracle Bare Metal Cloudservice

Zero Downtime Patching
- drain connections - will auto add server when restarted
- can also disable host and it will not automatically be added after restart
- put server in maiontenance mode in server pool

Web Logic Scripting Tool (WLST)
- python scripts
- cli for configuring/managing
- (http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E29542_01/nav/wlst.htm)
