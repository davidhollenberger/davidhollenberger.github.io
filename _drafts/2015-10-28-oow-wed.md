# Upgrade Hundreds or Thousands of Databases in a Reasonable Time
Mike Deitrich
[slides](http://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=202202:2:::::P2_SUCHWORT:OOW2015)

## Gather Data
Information to gather before starting database upgrade:
- DB Inventory
- OS Inventory
- App dependency and certification

Use tracking app or spreadsheet to track progress.  Build workstreams and DB groups to streamline upgrade process.

## Test
- Upgrade and Migration process testing
- Post upgrade testing
- post upgrade performance
    - Use AWR Diff reports
    - SQL performance analyzer

## Real Time Monitoring
EM Reports

DBA_HIST_REPORTS (mauro-pagano/)

SQL Developer - tools -> monitor sql -> show sql details

![SQl Developer Monitor SQL]({{ site.url }}/assets/sqldev-sql-monitoring.png)

DBMS_SQLTUNE.report_sql_monitor -> combines ASH and AWR?

```sql
@desc dbms_sqltune
@xp.sql  --TEXT mode
@xph.sql --HTML mode
@xpa.sql --ACTIVE mode (flash)
@sqlmon
```

## When does SQL monitoring kick in?
1. Manually and immediate w/ MONITOR hint.
2. Automatically and immediate for parallel statements
3. Automatically after 5 seconds of CPU/IO time of serial statement.
    - not full DB time.
    - will not monitor blocked statements (waiting, not on CPU)


**Hash Joins** buffer child results in PGA or write to Temp.

**Duration** - wall-clock time
**DB Time** - activity inside the DB including PX slaves

OEM - Activity tab
- by resource type
- by plan type
- like ASH for specific run of a query

12c new "other" column in execution plan time -- click the binoculars.

Getting bind variables from long-running sql.  Go to Monitoring -> show sql text -> show binds.

ASH plan line-level breakdown

```sql
@ash/asqlmon <sqlid> 1
@ashtop
@sqlmon_sn % --list metrics available in ASH
```

Plans with more than 300 lines are not monitored.  To monitor large sql statements (MOS ID: 1613163.1)


# Optimizing SQL for Performance and Maintainability

- Check out Oracle Github
- Dense Rank vs Rank
- lookup KEEP keyword
- in memory advisor
- Good for devs to use TKPROF and SQL Monitor report
